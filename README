README for ta_tools_config

This will allow you install TA Tools mods (linker, ape, radiant, etc.)
in a modular way. The file 'ta_tools_config.csv' is a configuration
file which specifies which DLL files to load for which tools.

'RemoteLogger.dll' is modified to contain the machinery that
processes this configuration file.

Run 'make' and 'make install'.

'ta_tools_config.csv' should either be in the working directory that is
invoking the tool, or in '${TA_TOOLS_PATH}/bin' (it is searched in that
order).

Installing new tools mods should be more convenient with this. You just
have to copy the mod DLL to '${TA_TOOLS_PATH}/bin', and then add a line
to 'ta_tools_config.csv':

<tool name>,<dll name>

For example:

linker,linker_lua.dll

Causes '${TA_TOOLS_PATH}/bin/linker_lua.dll' to be loaded every time
'linker_modtools.exe' runs.
